    // Since that's used only into testing it won't reach the developer production bundle,
    // we switched to use `lodash` directly even if it's not tree-shaked

    // dependencies and reduce runtime performance
    // I could not find a way to make TS compiler automatically transform ESM deps to CommonJS while transpiling TS files,
    // as lodash files are JS and thus not considered into TS transpilation step
    // See https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7001
